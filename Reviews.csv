Works amazing and buttery smooth, design kinda boring though",4,"-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty"

Worst quality now",2,"I am sharing this review and feedback after using it 10 months. Recent software update damaged it's motherboard completed and now service centre asked for INR 14,600 for changing  the motherboard as per them there has been leakage however there was liquid drop happened on the phone or it won't dropped/kept at any wet location.At same service centre found multiple customer who faced similar problems in very short span of used redmi phone (recently brought by them), it shows how much quality of product as dropped as product became no1 too early misusing it.I block now people should go with some other brands instead of redmi or Xiaomi products."

Good phone within budget",5,"My last phone was redmi 4 and after 5 years of enjoying it thoroughly and battery draining out faster than I could tolerate, I planned to switch to another. I opted for another redmi because I am used to using phones by this company now and I like them.Good review:1. You could switch data from redmi to redmi with the Mi Mover app. Your new phone will become a mirror image of your old phone. This believe me was such a time saver!2. The phone looks smart and classy3. Battery life is very good and the turbo charger that came with the phone is absolutely fantastic4. If you are not a big fan of expensive phones and can do just with a basic one but still good technology and smart look matter to you, this one is perfect. It fits your pocket well5. User interface is smooth and so far no problemsNot so good review:1. The phone is a little too big especially for women. But these days most phones are big because of their software and hardware technology. So this is not a major issue. You get used to it.2. Camera quality is good but could have been better.Overall review:If you are not too picky about smart phones and want a decent phone within 20K, this one is a very good choice. Go for it."

Midrange performer got power to skip 20k phone.",4,"Battery life and performance is good and charging with 33 watt is satisfactory. Could have more little more brightness expected in outdoors. Sound is good and watching media content is pleasing with its thin display edges. Ram management is need to improve, even if it having 6 gb ram plus 2 gb virtual ram features it kills most of apps in the background. Camera is average and need software update along with andriod 12. Front camera is good as compare to back. No any heating or lag issue in day to day uses. Call quality is good, loud and clear but lacks premium phone like quality. 5g capable with mediatek 810 . Security update is slower than low budget mi phones as now I received may month patch and it's already July month. Overall good phone but need improvement through update for sure. If you don't want to spend 20k on phone but need powerful and overall good package then you can go for it as all 5g phone under 20 k has lots of compromise but this has very few."

My Redmi Note 5 pro is better than Note 11T",3,"1-Redmi Note 5 Pro having battery 4000 mamp and this Note 11T having 5000 mamp still this is draining fast. I am using half apps compare to note 5 pro.2-My note 5 pro never got hanged in dual WhatsApp and inspite of 6GB RAM in this phone WhatsApp getting hanged. I am not able to attached photos, contacts a blank appearing in that space ?3-Earphone also having very low sound inspite raising it to full4-THIS CALL IS GETTING RECORDED audio getting while recording calls. Unable to disable this found which very BAD.5-Phone contacts edit option is NOT AVAILABLE AT ALL in phone.I and my family now having total 10+ redmi phones but due to this redmi note 11T performance I am not sure, I may think for buying redmi again...I am not returning this as my need of phone is more important than its performance.Secondly I had also send feedback from time to time but not received any revert over mail or on phone from redmi...So this is my feedback.... and choice is yours."

A very Average phone by Redmi!",3,"Its a new 5G phone, which was recieved in a good original packing. It is supporting 5G mobile network, which has not yet started in India. So I cant comment on that aspect of the phones capability.It has good sound in the earpiece, but its speaker sound is not that great. Mic is good.It catches wifi signals but somehow it tends to miss out on some 5GHZ networks arbitrarily. It just refuses to show all available wifi networks available.Camera is good, but dont expect good macro pics. Video quality is above average. Colours are a bit on the saturated side.Battery life with average use is 1.5 days. I am no gamer, so cant comment about battery life under intense gaming conditions.Finger print reader is on side button. It is not always sensitive. I love the looks of the instrument.I have yet to buy a screen protector. One comes pasted. But being plastic, it catches dust and tiny filth. I need to buy a glass one due to filth. The silicone back cover came with this phone, its nice.I can use IR blaster on phone to run my Atomberg ceiling fans!The phone feels warm sometimes. Phone is worth buying.______________________________________UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE.Taking videos in the sun is impossible. The phone heats and shuts down.Battery life is now just 1 dayIt's not behaving like an 8 Gb RAM phone. It tends to  lag.Overall I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE NOW. There are definitely better phones you can buy. If you can not evn make 2 min videos outdoors in peace.DONT BUY."

One of the Best Phone in the price range of 17K. But Camera is not good.",5,"3 Days Review:Unique findings:1. RAM Booster is available with a 6GB variant, it gives an additional 2 GB for RAM Booster. So you can have a total of 8GB RAM. But technically it's not similar to the 8GB Variant. 2GB RAM Booster will help you very mildly boost your phone Speed. But yes, you can tell your friends you have an 8GB+128GB variant. :)2. Auto Call Recording will tell the receiver that you are recording this call. to avoid this. You can install Truecaller which will give a separate call recording option that won't tell the receiver about the call recording.3. Charge your Phone when not in use to get a very fast charging than normal. switch off your, mobile data, wifi, hotspot, etc. put on the charge. it will be charged from 0-100% within an hour. Also always plugged in for charging when it reaches 30%-40% battery and stops at 99%. it gives the battery a longer life.4. 90HZ refresh rate will give you smooth operation but it also drains the battery. First, use it with 60HZ and see if you can manage with it, if not you can go for 90HZ.5. Switch to Dark mode, White mode will drain the battery faster compare to Dark mode.6. You can uninstall most of the preinstalled useless apps.7. Camera is good but the camera software is the worst. You can install camera apps like Camera MX or Open Camera for good-quality pictures.8. Put your brightness in Auto, It will adjust as per the surrounding lights also it's a battery saver.9. Finger Print Scanner can only unlock your device. it won't lock your device.10. Avoid locking your phone with the power button. the Power Button won't last long. Always let your phone be locked by itself by the set timer or you can manually lock your phone using the lock option in side of the phone.Next Update after a month."

One of the best 5g phone under 15-16 k.",4,"Fast charging, side fingerprint working fine, due to an inexpensive 5g mobile in 16 k camera is not very good but fine, main focus is a 5g mobile of redmi in 16k with 6-128 ram-rom pair. Android 12 can be upadated with miui 13, sometimes facing a little lag problem, battery is fine, some additional features are attractive. Better than other realme, iqoo, infinix 5g mobiles which are nearly 16 k."

Average phone",4,The phone specs are decent. Build quality and finger print sensors are nice. Camera quality is average but still can take some good pics. Since the processor is a 5g technology battery drain can occur a bit fast but still can long last a day for average users. Overall this phone is ideal for average to moderate users.

Nice phone but it needs to lite in weight",4,"After using 4 months, we can say MI has to improve much more in its phone. Processing, speaker, weight etc. And also in camera..... 50MP back camera is a joke. Selfie camera is good but improvment is required. Overall 3.5 rating we can give."

Overall a great phone under ?20k.",5,"Some reviews have heavily criticized this phone, however I've been using it for the past 5 days and it's been excellent.The display is amazing with great contrast and brightness along with a smooth 90hz display which looks amazing when scrolling or using the phone in general.The phone has a good processor which is more than enough to handle day to day tasks and good enough to handle games.The camera is great, with image stabilization, AI assistance, etc, but it's not the best of cameras which I've seen. The final image though, looks pretty good due to enhanced picture processing.It charges to 100% in under an hour or a bit more with the 33 Watt fast charger (I usually don't even need to charge it at night). The battery easily lasts a day with normal usage and can go upto 70-75 hours (3 days) with the battery saver on.The phone also has several quirks and features which I find helpful.The MiUI has a minimal and clean interface and is very easy to use and yet has a premium look to it. Small details are designed well, (such as window animations, titles, etc) which show the good quality of the UI.In my opinion, the Redmi 11T 5G is a phenomenal phone under ?20k."

The phone has only two problems as per my experience",4,"I would say the phone is good. I got this phone 6GB and 128GB variant at Rs12999 on a great festival sale on Amazon, and at this price, this phone is the best. The phone's camera is not up to the mark, and this phone comes with Android 11. All other things except these two are best in the phone.If you have any questions just ask me."

But camera quality is the thing which could be improved. However all other things are upto the mark and highly recommend product in this price range. One of the best 5G budget mobile

Good phone... Great price!",4,"Let's break it down and keep it simple:1. Battery life is good2. Smooth touch screen3. Good processing speed4. 5G enabled (but not a plus right now)5. Easy functionality and user friendly6. Turbo charge is too good7. Sound with speaker inbuilt8. Heavy duty performance9. Display is above averageBut....1. The adaptive brightness is not that great2. Camera is good (both front and back), but if you want an incredible camera, this is not it.Overall good phone built for performance... Not for selfie lovers and camera geeks.. So choose wisely ??"

Best Product Bought From Best Platform",5,"À 5G phone purchased at a unique price from Amazon on a Diwali Sale. Thank you. It was first time purchasing phone on Amazon went positive experience. 1st phone had a small functional defect in it, contacted the customer service and prompt response received. In next two days received this brand new phone. So WinWin situation for us. Phone have a classic themes for wallpapers category, Apple theme wallpaper is awesome. Feels like using an Apple phone.battery is awesome. Phone gets charged in like 30 min. To 100%. Battery is draining in very slow pace which is another upside. Camera is upto the mark. Overall performance is 5/5."
